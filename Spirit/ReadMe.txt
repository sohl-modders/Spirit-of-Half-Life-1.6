Spirit of Half-Life was originally created by Laurie Cheers, who was it's sole programmer up to version 1.2 .

Since then a number of people have conributed code, and I can't even begin to tell you who they all are. Contributers that I know about include Confused, G-Cont and the Shambler team, ytiAdmin, and Ryokeen. Confused was the programmer who compiled this version, Spirit of Half-Life 1.5 alpha 4. Confused is also probably the only one who knows who all the actual contributers were - unfortunately he's gone missing (watch for his face on milk cartons!).

Please check out the "Docs" folder for additional information you may need to map for Spirit.

The "Additional Files You May Need" folder contains files you will need to map OR play Spirit, but you may already have them, or even have newer versions. Since they could effect other mods, I've included them here to use at your option.

This particularly package of Spirit of Half-Life version 1.5alpha4 was assembled by Firebinder, 2007 August 15. I have included example maps and documentation taken from earlier versions of Spirit and from the now defunct Whiteplasma.com (home of the SoHL wiki, and the SoHL showcase).
